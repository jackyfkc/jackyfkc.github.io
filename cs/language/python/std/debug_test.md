### [pdb](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html)

### [pyringe](https://github.com/google/pyringe)

Pyringe is a python debugger capable of attaching to running processes, inspecting their state and even of injecting python code into them while they're running. With pyringe, you can list threads, get tracebacks, inspect locals/globals/builtins of running functions, all without having to prepare your program for it.
