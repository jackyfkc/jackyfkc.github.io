Concept
---

* Kafka is run as a `cluster` on one or more servers

* Kafka `cluster` stores streams of records in categories called `topic`

* Each `record` consists of a key, a value and a timestamp


## Partition

![Kafka log](images/kafka_log_anatomy.png "Anatomy of a Topic")

Each `partition` is an ordered, immutable sequence of records that is continually appended toâ€”a structured commit log.

The records in the partitions are each assigned a `sequential id number` called the offset that uniquely identifies each record within the partition.
