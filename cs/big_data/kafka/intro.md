Kafka
---

[Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) is a distributed, partitioned, replicated log based service. It provides functionality of a **messaging system**, but with a very different design.


Why Queue?

* Makes each data set to be multi-subscriber

* Ensure the order is maintained in the processing

* Provide buffering

* Effectively decoupling producers and consumers of data within the pipeline
